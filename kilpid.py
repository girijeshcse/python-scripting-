'''Write a script that does the following:

Takes a port_number as its only argument.
Calls out to lsof to determine if there is a process listening on that port.
If there is a process, kill the process and inform the user.
If there is no process, print that there was no process running on that port.
Pythonâ€™s standard library comes with an HTTP server that you can use to start a server listening on a port (5500 in this case) with this line:

$ python -m http.server 5500'''
